## 2026-09-22 — Repository setup + plan

- Repo scaffolded (structure only, no logic) so the plan could be the
  first meaningful commit, per the brief.
- Wrote `docs/PLAN.md`: problem framing, architecture, data contract,
  failure policy, and five decisions (D1–D5) — brief asked for three.
- Blocker: raw `git push` was rejected by the sandbox's egress proxy
  (repo not yet authorized). Resolved by pushing through the connected
  GitHub app instead.
- User asked for `PLAN.md` to be trimmed — brief says it should be short.
  Cut ~40% of the prose while keeping all five required sections.
